### File Processing

- The uploaded text file is read, and each line is checked to ensure it contains a valid integer.
- Only unique integers within the range of -1023 to 1023 are considered.
- The unique integers are sorted and saved to a new text file.
- The result page provides a link to download the processed file.

### Available at Domain
